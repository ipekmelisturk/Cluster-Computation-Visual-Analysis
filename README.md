# Cluster-Computation-Visual-Analysis
This project includes a parallelized convolution algorithm where an image and sobel filter is multiplied using multi-threadding and tracked performance using PAPI and Perf libraries. The visulaziton is implemented using JavaScript and analyze performance and HW utilization for different images.
